            <h2>Human-robot</h2>
            <p>In human-robot collaboration, the robot assists the human operator. This means: The machine does not replace the human, but complements his capabilities and relieves him of arduous tasks. These can include overhead work, for example, or the lifting of heavy loads. Autonomous, collaborative robots are also used to supply production workstations</p>

                <p>Hitting the show floor at CES can be something of a challenge. There are so many choices, it’s almost impossible to figure out where to even start. So this year, I got to narrow my focus to just one area — robotics — and it made my job a lot easier. Or it should have. Turns out, there are so many choices in the field of robotics, I was back where I started.</p>

                    <p>The number of robots in the world today is approaching 1,000,000, with almost half that number in Japan and just 15% in the US. A couple of decades ago, 90% of robots were used in car manufacturing, typically on assembly lines doing a variety of repetitive tasks. Today only 50% are in automobile plants, with the other half spread out among other factories, and many other industries.</p>

                <p>How many want to subject themselves to black lung disease and a host of other health problems from that job? This is why coal mining towns are dying out. Young people in these towns are moving on to the brighter job prospects. And technology is taking over what’s left of the mining industry. Green energy is taking over, and with it, a host of new, clean jobs and careers. It’s the march of civilization that will never cease.</p>
